<h2 style='text-align: center;'>Backstory </h2>
<p>___ was made so that everyone can explore out of popular music.<br> I've always wondered, I wanna listen to less popular music artists rather than only the very popular songs, while still being in the range of my music taste, and so this app was created. <br>You are able to submit a certain playlist of yours, and pick genres you want to explore, or just your own genres, and it will recommend you a few new songs that you may like.<br> Don't worry, I won't collect your information either, you don't even have to log it, and I only have access to public playlists everyone can already see! </p>
